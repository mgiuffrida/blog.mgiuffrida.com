Although Windows users have been [raising privacy concerns](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-violates-your-privacy-by-default-heres-how-you-can-protect-yourself/) about Windows 10
since the Technical Preview, and some data [cannot be protected without
disabling Windows features](), Windows 10 [provides](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9409557/microsoft-windows-10-privacy-concerns-response)
fairly comprehensive settings for what gets shared.

Unfortunately, at least some of these settings *don't actually stick* and are
silently **immediately reset back to "enabled"**. Here's my attempt to disable
the core "Search online and include web results" feature, which should determine
whether Windows reports every query I search for to Bing. As you can see, the
toggle button cannot stay off:

Here's hoping this is just a bug, or better yet, a fluke limited to my machine.
But for now, I can't find a way to prevent Windows from automatically forwarding
my desktop searches to Bing.
